# Foudations of Data Analysis - Projects

### Lab 1 - Manual implementation and training of a regularized stochastic regression model using stochastic gradient descent and plotting of the separating hyperplane.

### Lab 2 - Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and comparison of different clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, KMeans, EM & Average Link).
